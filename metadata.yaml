description: This political zine, first published in 1914 by celebrated anarchist
  Emma Goldman, was reprinted with the help of Anarchy Archives. In the essay, Goldman
  asserts that marriage is not an indicator of love and that the institution disenfranchises
  women and discounts female sexuality.
